## AI Tools Used

- GitHub Copilot

## How they are used

- Copilot used to generate JavaDoc documentation for extracted 11 command classes. This was done during
  the `A-CodeQuality` increment.

## Observations

- Copilot was effective in generating documentation for similar classes,
  as it seemed to quickly recognise the patterns in the documentation
  of similar classes, which sped up the repetitive and mundane process of writing
  documentations of similar classes.

  Overall time saved: Hours perhaps
